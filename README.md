# timer
custom timer for my ADHD ass lol

## Usage
Just pass in time as the argument along with the call for binary.

Format: `hhmmss`

Example: `004402` for `00h44m02s`

Name your file sample1 and in wav format if you don't wanna edit the path and build the binary again.

For one off timer, use `./<binary name> <time> &` [WARNING: You have to wait till the song is done playing, no way to stop it.]

NOTE: Only for ubuntu. The included audio file is a custom tune played by me and with a little bit of background chat.
